# Installer Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Complete `config.php` Generation
The installer now generates a complete `config.php` file that matches `config.example.php` exactly, including:

- ✅ All database configuration constants
- ✅ All base path constants (BASE_DIR, INCLUDES_DIR, DATA_DIR, UPLOADS_DIR, etc.)
- ✅ JSON file path constants (EMPLOYEES_JSON, TEMPLATES_JSON, GENERATED_JSON)
- ✅ Site settings (SITE_NAME, SITE_DESCRIPTION)
- ✅ Timezone configuration
- ✅ Error reporting settings
- ✅ Complete billing configuration with proper `if (!defined())` checks
- ✅ DatabaseAdapter initialization
- ✅ Proper includes for Database.php, functions.php, and DatabaseAdapter.php

### 2. Directory Creation
The installer now automatically creates all required directories:

- ✅ `data/` - For JSON fallback storage
- ✅ `data/companies/` - For per-company JSON files
- ✅ `uploads/` - For file uploads
- ✅ `uploads/companies/` - For per-company uploads
- ✅ `uploads/templates/` - For template images
- ✅ `uploads/cards/` - For generated cards
- ✅ `uploads/excel/` - For Excel imports

All directories are created with proper permissions (0755) and the installer provides feedback on which directories were created.

### 3. Configuration Verification
Added verification steps to ensure:

- ✅ `config.php` file was successfully created
- ✅ All required constants are present in the generated file
- ✅ Proper error messages if verification fails

### 4. Billing Configuration
Improved billing configuration handling:

- ✅ Proper `if (!defined())` checks for all billing constants
- ✅ Prevents undefined constant warnings
- ✅ Supports Amwal Pay, Stripe, or 'none'
- ✅ All billing constants are always defined (even if empty)

## What the Installer Now Does

1. **Step 1: Requirements Check**
   - Verifies PHP version, extensions, and file permissions
   - Checks directory writability

2. **Step 2: Database Configuration**
   - Tests database connection
   - Stores credentials in session

3. **Step 3: Database Migration**
   - Creates all database tables
   - Sets up schema

4. **Step 4: Site Configuration**
   - Collects site name, description, timezone

5. **Step 5: Billing Configuration**
   - Optional: Configure Amwal Pay or Stripe
   - Can skip for later configuration

6. **Step 6: Admin Account**
   - Creates first admin company account

7. **Step 7: Finalization**
   - ✅ Creates all required directories
   - ✅ Generates complete `config.php` file
   - ✅ Verifies `config.php` was created correctly
   - ✅ Verifies all required constants exist
   - ✅ Updates system settings in database
   - ✅ Creates admin company account
   - ✅ Marks installation as complete

## Generated `config.php` Structure

The generated `config.php` includes:

```php
<?php
// Session start
// Database configuration (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_PORT, DB_TYPE)
// Base paths (BASE_DIR, INCLUDES_DIR, DATA_DIR, UPLOADS_DIR, etc.)
// JSON file paths (EMPLOYEES_JSON, TEMPLATES_JSON, GENERATED_JSON)
// Site settings (SITE_NAME, SITE_DESCRIPTION)
// Timezone
// Error reporting
// Billing configuration (with if (!defined()) checks)
// Include required files (Database.php, functions.php, DatabaseAdapter.php)
// Initialize database connection
// Initialize DatabaseAdapter
```

## Testing Checklist

After installation, verify:

- [ ] `config.php` exists in root directory
- [ ] All directories are created (`data/`, `uploads/`, etc.)
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] Admin account can login
- [ ] No PHP warnings about undefined constants
- [ ] DatabaseAdapter initializes correctly
- [ ] All includes work correctly

## Files Modified

- `install/index.php` - Enhanced `generateConfigFile()` function and added directory creation and verification
