# Startup Vision: Multi-Tenant Virtual Business Cards

## One-liner
Give companies a branded, self-serve portal to manage employees and instantly generate downloadable business cards (PNG/PDF) with QR codes.

## Problem
- Creating consistent business cards is slow and manual (design files, back-and-forth, outdated data).
- Onboarding/offboarding means business card info changes frequently.
- Companies want brand consistency across departments and locations.

## Solution
A SaaS platform where each company has its own portal:
- Company admin uploads/creates templates, manages employees.
- Employees generate their own cards instantly using their company email.
- Cards stay consistent with brand guidelines.

## Target users
1. SMBs and scale-ups onboarding frequently
2. Agencies providing brand collateral
3. Enterprises needing governance, audit, and SSO (later)

## Core value props
- **Instant generation**: no design cycle for each employee.
- **Brand consistency**: templates + locked rules.
- **Self-serve**: HR/Marketing control, employees download immediately.
- **Multi-language**: EN/AR support (already present in MVP).

## MVP features (what we have + what we aim for)

- Employee management ✅
- Generate card images ✅
- Company separation (multi-tenant) ⏭
- Company login / role system ⏭

## Monetization
